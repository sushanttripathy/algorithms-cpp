Implementations of commonly used algorithms in C++

For instances of use please see main.cpp. 

Almost all of these are templated classes with easy to understand method names (most of the methods follow standard nomenclature). There is no library dependency of any sort; these sources have been tested on gcc 6.4. They will also work with MingW compilers.

Implementations of note are :

1. Red-Black Binary Search Tree
2. Interval Tree deried from Red-Black Binary Search Tree
3. Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
4. Segment Tree (Interface)
